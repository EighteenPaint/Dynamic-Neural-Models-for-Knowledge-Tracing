Student Performance Prediction Using Dynamic Neural Models


We  address  the  problem  of  predicting  the  correctness  of the studentâ€™s response on the next exam question based on their  previous  interactions  in  the  course  of  their  learning and evaluation process.  We model the student performance as a dynamic problem and compare the two major classes of dynamic neural architectures for its solution, namely the finite-memory  Time  Delay  Neural  Networks  (TDNN)  and the potentially infinite-memory Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). Since the next response is a function of the knowledge state of the student and this, in turn, is a function of their previous responses and the skills associated with th eprevious questions, we propose a two-part network architecture.  The first part employs a dynamic neural network (either TDNN or RNN) to trace the student knowledge state.The second part applies on top of the dynamic part and it is  a  multi-layer  feed-forward  network  which  completes  the classification task of predicting the student response based on our estimate of the student knowledge state.
